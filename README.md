# VKSplatter ??

This project was started as both of a reason to practice Vulkan and some novel view rendering like Gaussian Splatting hence the name.
Currently it is usable but very WIP, due to some conflicting vision view so hold on.

# Build

* Build is pretty standard Cmake stuff
* Clone the repository
* Required dependency GLFW, GLM, Vulkan then CMake
* Create a build folder and build within it
