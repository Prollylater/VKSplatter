# VKSplatter ??

This project was started as both of a reason to practice Vulkan and some novel view rendering like Gaussian Splatting hence the name.
Currently it is very WIP, due to some conflicting vision view. 
Going forward, what is basically still, an ugly .exe will move toward a RHI/Framework at the bottom layer, a RenderEngine both as library.

# Build

* Build is pretty standard Cmake stuff, however at the current state it could require at least going into the code and changing shader + ress
