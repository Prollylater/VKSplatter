Core / Platform (Currently blended with GRaphics API)
	Instance, physical device manager, debug layers, window system integration (GLFW/SDL, etc.).

Graphics API Abstraction (vulkan) 
	Wraps Vulkan objects (command buffer, pipeline, framebuffer, descriptor set, etc.).
	Provides utilities for resource management.

Renderer (render)

	High-level orchestration: draw loop, UBO updates, scene management.
	Defines the API context and stuff

Application Layer (Currently the renderer)
  Uses the renderer(s ?) directly 
  Owns game logic, scene loading, UI, etc.
